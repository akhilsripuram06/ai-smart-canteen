The **AI-Powered Smart Canteen Reservation System** is a web-based application that helps students reserve meals in advance while reducing overcrowding in canteens. It uses basic machine learning techniques to predict popular meals and suggest less busy dining times based on historical data. The system includes a student-facing app for meal reservations and an admin dashboard for managing meals and viewing demand trends. The application is developed using Python (Flask), SQLite or Firebase, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is supported by UML diagrams and user authentication to demonstrate clear system design and functionality.
